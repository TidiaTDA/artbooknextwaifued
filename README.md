## FAQ

-How did  you  choose the characters?

Availability of suitable  official artwork, iconicity, personal taste, priority to first party characters.

-Why  is  system  uncustomized?

Wasn't a priority/couldn't  think of a good character/couldn't  find  official art of them. I am  not  against  adding more in the feature so you can request  but I make no promises.
