A custom scheme for ESDE's artbook next


## Getting  Started

### Installing

If  you dont have  it, install artbook next from https://github.com/anthonycaccese/art-book-next-es-de  
Move the theme-customizations folder inside your artbook next folder.
IMPORTANT: if you are on Android, your artbooknext theme has to be in the ESDE/themes folder, if you intall
the custom theme in the Android/Data/org.esde.frontend folder it WON'T WORK.

### Applying  theme

Apply the artbooknext theme in ESDE.

From ESDE's main menu go to UI settings -> theme color scheme -> custom

## FAQ

-How did you choose the characters?

Availability of suitable official artwork, icon status, personal taste, priority to first party characters.
I also avoided representing any franchise more than once.

-What's with the uncustomized systems?

Weren't a priority/couldn't  think of a good character/couldn't  find  official art of them. I am  not  against  adding more in the future so you can issue a request,  but I make no promises.

Thank you to GenoCL for the idea of the multi-artwork system view. It got me to think about ES themes in a different way when building it out and it came out awesome.
