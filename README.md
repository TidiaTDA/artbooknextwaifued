Original artbooknext theme and assets by https://github.com/anthonycaccese
This project was inspired by a similar Daijisho project: https://daijishou.github.io/Gallery/wallpapers\_pack#ModernWaifu

INSTRUCTIONS:

If you dont have it, install artbook next from https://github.com/anthonycaccese/art-book-next-es-de
Move the theme-customizations theme inside your artbook next folder.

From ESDE's main menu go to UI settings -> theme color scheme -> custom


IMPORTANT: android users you need to have the theme in your ESDE/themes folder, it won't work if you install it in the internal data folder the theme will be found in if you download it through ESDE.

FAQs:

-How did you choose the characters?

Availability of suitable official artwork, iconicity, personal taste, priority to first party characters.

-Why is *system* uncustomized?

Wasn't a priority/couldn't think of a good character/couldn't find official art of them. I am not against adding more in the feature so you can request but I make no promises.
