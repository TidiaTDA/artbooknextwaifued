## Getting  Started

### Installing

Move the theme-customizations folder inside your artbook next folder.

the custom theme in the Android/Data/org.esde.frontend folder it WON'T WORK.

## FAQ

-How did you choose the characters?

Availability of suitable official artwork, icon status, personal taste, priority to first party characters.
I also avoided representing any franchise more than once.

-What's with the uncustomized systems?

Weren't a priority/couldn't  think of a good character/couldn't  find  official art of them. I am  not  against  adding more in the future so you can issue a request,  but I make no promises.
